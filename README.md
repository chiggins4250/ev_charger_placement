# EV Charger Placement in Virginia for Residential Vehicles
The purpose of this analysis is to inform decision making on EV charger placement in Virginia for Level 2 and DC fast chargers. Some important questions to consider are:
1. Where are their gaps in the current placement of the chargers?
2. What are some potential locations that are less than 1 mile from a main road?
3. How can the placement of the EV chargers also serve those in disadvantaged commmunities?
This code preliminarily aims to address the first question but can be further improved upon to expand its capabilities.
